## Welcome to epigenesis

_epigenesis_ is a **new** code standard framework which wants to help you to develop and deploy Web Applications without syntax errors, grammar faults, duplicated content, and attributes, and with a real _epigeneses_ experience.

But,

### What is the Epigenesis?

_noun_ | epi·gen·e·sis

> “[epigenesis](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epigenesis) development of a plant or animal from an egg or spore through a series of processes in which unorganized cell masses differentiate into organs and organ systems”;

That’s the base for [Epigenetic Theory](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epigenetic), which says that “chemical changes to DNA and its associated proteins—that modify gene activity without altering the genetic information itself”.

**TL;DR** they says that if you are changed by the environment it don't will change your genetics itself, only your external “layout”.

This is what we think about development. The gene itself is just the litle piece of what is deployed, but, if the environment can changes and defines the “visible” you, why can’t should I make the cern better?

Yeah, this is a _nonsense_ argument, which below are explained for a dev human, or, a AI machine, Doctor Who knows? Let’s make _epigeneses_.
